    @Title: ShiftSpace
    @Desc: For example, you can use the space bar both as a normal Space bar and as a Shift.
    Intuitively, it'll be a Space when you want a whitespace, and a Shift when you want it to act as a shift.
    I.e. when you simply press and release it, it is the usual space,
    but when you press other keys, say X, Y and Z, while holding down the space,
    then they will be treated as â‡§ Shift plus X, Y and Z.

~*LShift up::
    ; @TODO without * it's faster, but with it you can produce a space while you hold a key, e.g. when tying speedy
