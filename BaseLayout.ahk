@Title: ShiftSpace
@Desc: For example, you can use the space bar both as a normal Space bar and as a Shift.
Intuitively, it'll be a Space when you want a whitespace, and a Shift when you want it to act as a shift. 
I.e. when you simply press and release it, it is the usual space,  
but when you press other keys, say X, Y and Z, while holding down the space, 
then they will be treated as â‡§ Shift plus X, Y and Z.
